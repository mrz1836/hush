**hush is a single Go binary that keeps every API key, OAuth token, and
service credential encrypted on a single trusted host. Agents request
short-lived, scoped sessions over Tailscale; the request is approved on
your phone via Discord; approved secrets are delivered ECIES-encrypted
end-to-end and injected into the agent process's environment — never
written to disk on the agent machine.**

If your dev workflow runs untrusted code (npm/pip packages, LLM-generated
scripts, AI-agent tools that execute shell commands) and your secrets
currently live in shell rc files or cloud-provider credential files, hush
is for you. Vault, 1Password CLI, and dotfile-based env vars all leave
files on disk that commodity malware grep for first. hush makes those
files not exist.

<br>

## Quick start

> **Status:** v0.1.0 is a private MVP. Treat the steps below as the
> documented happy path, not a guarantee.

Prerequisites: a vault host and an agent host on the same Tailscale
tailnet, plus a Discord bot you control
(<https://discord.com/developers/applications>) for the approval channel.

Build and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrz1836/hush.git && cd hush
magex build && sudo install -m 0755 cmd/hush/hush /usr/local/bin/hush
```

Bootstrap the vault host — **one guided command, then add secrets before serve**:

```bash
hush init server          # guided / interactive; preflight + prompts
hush secret add OPENAI_API_KEY
hush serve                # binds Tailscale interface, brokers approvals
```

During `hush init server`, set `discord_approval_channel_id` if you want
approvals in a Discord channel instead of owner DMs. On macOS, if the login
Keychain is locked or unavailable, choose the env-token fallback and run
`hush serve` with `HUSH_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` exported in that terminal.

Enrol the agent host:

```bash
hush init client --machine-index 1
hush request \
  --server "http://<vault-host-tailscale-ip>:7743/h/<path-prefix>" \
  --machine-index 1 --scope OPENAI_API_KEY \
  --max-uses 1 --ttl 5m --reason "smoke test" \
  --exec printenv -- OPENAI_API_KEY
```

Approve on Discord; the child process you named in `--exec` runs with
`OPENAI_API_KEY` in its environment — and only there. `--exec` names a
program, not a shell string; pass child arguments after `--`. Nothing is
written to disk on the agent host.

`hush init server` is the canonical first-run entry point. It runs a
diagnostic-first preflight, prompts for the inputs it actually needs,
classifies pre-existing state per-artifact, and never silently overwrites.
When it asks for a listen address, use the **vault host's Tailscale IPv4**
plus a free port (for example, run `printf '%s:7743\n' "$(tailscale ip -4)"`
on the server host). Do not use the laptop/client IP.

`--non-interactive` mode — see [`docs/OPERATIONS.md`](docs/OPERATIONS.md).

## At a glance

**What hush does:**

- Keeps every secret encrypted in a single AES-256-GCM + Argon2id (256MB) vault file on one trusted host.
- Requires phone approval (Discord DM with interactive buttons) for every fresh session.
- Delivers secrets ECIES-encrypted end-to-end into agent process memory only — no disk writes on the agent.

**What hush explicitly does NOT do (v0.1.0):**

- No multi-owner approvals (a single configured operator approves; multi-owner is post-v0.1.0 future scope).
- No cloud KMS / SaaS dependency. The vault is self-hosted and offline-capable.
- No public network exposure. The vault server is bound to a Tailscale interface and refuses to start otherwise.

## Why hush exists

When untrusted code lands on a developer machine — via npm/pip
supply-chain attacks, LLM-generated scripts, or trojans masquerading as
tools — the very first thing it does is enumerate known credential
patterns in known files: shell rc files, cloud-provider credential
files, `.env` files, signing keys, and PEM files.

**hush exists to make this enumeration return nothing.** Secrets stay
encrypted on a single trusted host. Agents fetch them only after a human
approves the request from a phone. Approved secrets are delivered into
process memory and zeroed when the process exits. Nothing on disk.

For the full threat model, see [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md).

<br>

## Architecture summary

hush is a single Go binary playing three roles:

- **Vault server** — holds the encrypted vault file in mlocked memory;
  issues ES256K-signed JWTs after Discord approval; ECIES-encrypts
  secret responses to the client's per-session ephemeral public key;
  exposes a tiny HTTP API over Tailscale only.
- **Interactive client** — ECDSA-signs a claim with a per-machine
  BIP32-derived key; receives a JWT after approval; fetches and
  decrypts secrets; injects them into a child process's environment.
- **Supervisor** — long-lived per-daemon process that holds the JWT and
  ephemeral ECIES key in mlocked memory across child crashes/restarts
  within the session TTL; runs validators before child start; exposes a
  Unix status socket for agent-visible freshness queries.

**Seven security layers** stack independently — compromise of any single
layer does not enable secret extraction:

1. **BIP32 HD key hierarchy** — all keys derived at runtime from a
   single passphrase. **Zero key files on disk.**
2. **ES256K asymmetric JWT signing** — only the server can sign;
   leaking the public key does not enable forgery.
3. **ECIES end-to-end secret transport** — secrets are encrypted to a
   per-session ephemeral pubkey; captured HTTP traffic shows binary
   blobs.
4. **ECDSA-signed client requests** — every claim and revocation is
   signed with a registered per-machine client key.
5. **mlocked secure memory** — `SecureBytes` containers; secrets never
   stored as Go `string`; explicit zeroing on shutdown.
6. **Signed hash-chained audit log** — every event ECDSA-signed; chain
   breaks on modification.
7. **Obscurity** — random API path prefix, custom vault file format,
   non-obvious binary name. Additive only — never load-bearing.

The network perimeter is **Tailscale-only** (Constitution Principle VI).
Tailscale is the v0.1.0 mesh-VPN choice; the architecture does not depend
on it specifically — the requirement is "no public reachability" and
Tailscale satisfies it cleanly. The `Approver` interface is also
pluggable; **Discord is the v0.1.0 reference implementation** and the
only one that ships, but future Slack / Telegram / PagerDuty backends can
be wired without changing the rest of the system.

For the full architecture treatment, see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

<br>

## Tech stack

- **[Go 1.26+](https://go.dev/)** — single static binary, `CGO_ENABLED=0`
  exclusively (Constitution Principle IX).
- **[decred/dcrd/dcrec/secp256k1/v4](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)** —
  secp256k1 primitives used for ECDSA signing, ES256K JWTs, and ECIES
  envelope encryption (Constitution Principle III).
- **[decred/dcrd/hdkeychain/v3](https://github.com/decred/dcrd)** — BIP32
  HD key derivation from the operator passphrase (Constitution Principle
  III); paired with stdlib `golang.org/x/crypto/argon2` for the KDF.
- **[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)** — the only network reachable to
  the vault server. WireGuard underneath; identity-based ACLs above.
- **[Discord](https://discord.com/)** + **[discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)**
  — phone-based approval channel; the v0.1.0 reference Approver.
- **[golang-jwt/jwt v5](https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt)** — JWT framework;
  hush registers a custom `ES256K` signing method.
- **[go-toml v2](https://github.com/pelletier/go-toml)** — strict TOML
  parsing for server and supervisor configs.
- **[zalando/go-keyring](https://github.com/zalando/go-keyring)** — OS
  keychain access with ACL support.
- **[cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)** + **[pflag](https://github.com/spf13/pflag)** —
  CLI subcommand routing and flag parsing.

The `SecureBytes` mlock pattern is custom-implemented in
`internal/vault/securebytes/`; the design is inspired by
[sigil](https://github.com/mrz1836/sigil) but takes no dependency on it.
hush itself is built using the [Spec-Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
spec-driven development methodology — see
[`docs/SDD-GUIDE.md`](docs/SDD-GUIDE.md).

## Goals

The v0.1.0 goal is a working private MVP that proves the threat model in
practice: an agent machine with a clean disk, a vault host on a phone-gated
Tailscale mesh, and a daily dev workflow that no longer requires
plaintext credentials anywhere on the agent.

**Post-v0.1.0 / future scope** (any of these may become a future release;
none is on the v0.1.0 critical path):

- Multi-owner approvals
- Slack / Telegram / PagerDuty Approver backends (the interface is
  already pluggable)
- Shamir passphrase splitting (sigil's SSS) for vault recovery
- Web dashboard
- Proxy mode (vault proxying provider API calls instead of injecting
  tokens)
- Agent-side credential proxy (per-provider HTTP proxy on the agent host)
- TLS within Tailscale (defence-in-depth on top of WireGuard)
- TOTP second factor on Discord approval
- Custom validator authoring SDK
